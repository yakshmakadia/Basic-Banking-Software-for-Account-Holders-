   - Transactions are processed only if sufficient funds are available.

5. **Exit Option**
   - Users can exit the banking system at any time.

## Conclusion
The **Basic Banking Software** was successfully implemented, allowing account holders to perform secure transactions. Future enhancements can include:
- **Database Integration** for persistent data storage.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for better usability.
- **Encryption** to secure user credentials.

This project demonstrates a functional prototype of an account management system, providing a foundation for more advanced banking applications.
